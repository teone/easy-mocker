# Development Notes

This is the series of actions that needs to be executed to start the server:

[x] Read Configuration (check validity)
[x] Build MemoryStorage
[x] Load base data into MemoryStorage
[x] Create the routes (pass a reference to the storage)
[ ] Refactor apiBuilder (split in smaller function)
[ ] Persist changes in storage (to easily test and prepare for a DB)

TODO:
 - Evaluate [LokiJs](http://lokijs.org/#/), [locallydb](https://github.com/btwael/locallydb)
